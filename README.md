This repository contains the TeX input files and media necessary to build my M.ASc thesis, titled "Coupled Radiation Transport and Mobile Depletion for
Health Physics and Environmental Impact Applications".

The thesis can be viewed by downloading and opening the file titled "thesis.pdf". Alternatively, it can be built from scratch by uploading the contents of this repository to a new Overleaf project and compiling.
